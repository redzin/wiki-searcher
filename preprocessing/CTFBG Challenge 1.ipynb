       "'the domestic cat is a small typically furry carnivorous mammal they are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines cats are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin there are more than 70 cat breeds though different associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards cats are similar in cat anatomyanatomy to the other felids with a strong flexible body quick reflexes sharp retractable claws and teeth adapted to killing small prey cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory ecological niche cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears such as those made by mice and other small animals they can see in near darkness like most other mammals cats have poorer color vision and a better sense of smell than humans cats despite being solitary hunters are a social animalsocial species and cat communication includes the use of a variety of animal communicationvocalizations as well as cat pheromones and types of cat body languagecatspecific body language cats have a high breeding rate under controlled breeding they can be bred and shown as cat registryregistered pedigree pets a hobby known as cat fancy failure to control the breeding of pet cats by neutering as well as the abandoned petsabandonment of former household pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide requiring animal population controlpopulation control in certain areas outside cats native range this has contributed along with habitat destruction and other factors to the extinction of many bird species cats have been known to extirpate a bird species within specific regions and may have contributed to the extinction of isolated island populations impact of feral cats in australia cats are thought to be primarily responsible for the extinction of 33 species of birds and the presence of feral and

concern american bird conservancy 31 may 2005 since cats were cats in ancient egyptvenerated in ancient egypt they were commonly believed to have been domesticated there but there may have been instances of domestication as early as the neolithic from around 9500 years ago a genetic study in 2007 concluded that domestic cats are descended from near eastern wildcats having diverged around 8000 bc in the middle east a 2016 study found that leopard cats were undergoing domestication independently in china around 5500 bc though this line of partially domesticated cats leaves no trace in the domesticated populations of today a 2017 study confirmed that domestic cats are descendants of those first domesticated by farmers in the near east around 9000 years ago as of a 2007 study cats are the second most popular pet in the us by number of pets owned behind fishkeepingfreshwaterfreshwater fish in a 2010 study they were ranked the third most popular pet in the uk after fish and dogs with around 8 million being owned statistics about pets in the uk 2010 society for companion animal studies retrieved 15 november 2016 taxonomy and evolution the domestic cat is believed to have evolved from the african wildcatnear eastern wildcat whose range covers vast portions of the middle east westward to the atlantic coast of africa between 70000 and 100000 years ago the animal gave rise to the genetic lineage that eventually produced all domesticated cats house cat origin traced to middle eastern wildcat ancestor brian handwerk for national geographic news 28 june 2007 having diverged from the near eastern wildcat around 8000 bc in the middle east the felids are a rapidly evolving family of mammals that share a common ancestor only 1015nbspmillion years ago and include lions tigers cougars and many others within this family domestic cats are part of the genus felis which is a group of small cats containing about seven species members of the genus are found worldwide and include the jungle cat of southeast asia european wildcat african wildcat the chinese mountain cat and the arabian sand cat among others the domestic cat was first classified as felis catus by carl linnaeus in the 10th edition of his 10th edition of systema naturaesystema naturae published in 1758 because of modern phylogenetics domestic cats are usually regarded as another subspecies of the wildcat f silvestris this has resulted in mixed usage of the terms as the domestic cat can be called by its subspecies name felis silvestris catus wildcats have also been referred to as various subspecies of f catus but in 2003 the international commission on zoological nomenclature fixed the name for wildcats as f silvestris the most common name in use for the domestic cat remains f catus sometimes the domestic cat has been called felis domesticus as proposed by german naturalist johann christian polycarp erxlebenjcp erxleben in 1777 but these are not valid taxonomic names and have been used only rarely in scientific literature a population of transcaucasian black feral cats was once classified as felis daemon but now this population is considered to be a part of domestic cat all the cats in this genus share a common ancestor that is believed to have lived around 67nbspmillion years ago in the near east the exact relationships within the felidae are close but still uncertain eg the chinese mountain cat is sometimes classified as a subspecies of the wildcat like the north african variety f s lybica filebastetistanbulmuseumjpgrightthumbancient egyptian sculpture of the cat goddess bastet the earliest evidence of felines as egyptian deities comes from a c 3100 bc in comparison to dogs cats have not undergone major changes during the domestication process as the form and behavior of the domestic cat is not radically different from those of wildcats and domestic cats are perfectly capable of surviving in the wild fully domesticated house cats often interbreed with feral f catus populations producing hybrids such as the kellas cat this limited evolution during domestication means that hybridisation can felid hybriddomestic cat and hybridizationoccur with many other felids notably the asian leopard cat several natural behaviors and characteristics of wildcats may have predisposed them for domestication as pets these traits include their small size social nature obvious body language love of play and relatively high intelligence several small felid species may have an inborn tendency towards tameness cats have either a mutualism mutualistic or commensal relationship with humans two main theories are given about how cats were domesticated in one people deliberately tamed cats in a process of artificial selection as they were useful predators of vermin this has been criticized as implausible because the reward for such an effort may have been too little cats generally do not carry out commands and although they do eat rodents other species such as ferrets or terriers may be better at controlling these pests the alternative idea is that cats were simply tolerated by people and gradually diverged from their wild relatives through natural selection as they adapted to hunting the vermin found around humans in towns and villages nomenclature and etymology the english word wiktcatenglishcat is in origin a

mongrels or muttcats while the african wildcat is the ancestral subspecies from which domestic cats are descended and wildcats and domestic cats can completely interbreed several intermediate stages occur between domestic pet and pedigree cats on one hand and entirely wild animals on the other the semiferal cat a mostly outdoor cat is not owned by any one individual but is generally friendly to people and may be fed by several households feral cats are associated with human habitation areas and may be fed by people or forage for food but are typically wary of human interaction biology

7 september 2012 the smallest adult cat ever officially recorded weighed around feral cats tend to be lighter as they have more limited access to food than house cats in the boston area the average feral adult male will weigh and average feral female cats average about in height and in headbody length with tails averaging in length cats have seven cervical vertebrae as do almost all mammals 13 thoracic vertebrae seven lumbar vertebrae three sacral vertebrae like most mammals and a variable number of caudal vertebrae in the tail the extra lumbar and thoracic vertebrae account for the cats spinal mobility and flexibility attached to the spine are 13 ribs the shoulder and the pelvis unlike human arms cat forelimbs are attached to the shoulder by freefloating clavicle bones which allow them to pass their body through any space into which they can fit their head filecat skulljpgthumbleftcat skull the cat skull is unusual among mammals in having very large eye sockets and a powerful and specialized jaw within the jaw cats have teeth adapted for killing prey and tearing meat when it overpowers its prey a cat delivers a lethal neck bite with its two long canine toothcanine teeth inserting them between two of the preys vertebrae and severing its spinal cord causing irreversible paralysis and death compared to other felines domestic cats have narrowly spaced canine teeth which is an adaptation to their preferred prey of small rodents which have small vertebrae the premolar and first molar molar together compose the carnassial pair on each side of the mouth which efficiently shears meat into small pieces like a pair of scissors these are vital in feeding since cats small molar molars cannot chew food effectively and cats are largely incapable of mastication though cats tend to have better teeth than most humans with decay generally less likely because of a thicker protective layer of enamel a less damaging saliva less retention of food particles between teeth and a diet mostly devoid of sugar they are nonetheless subject to occasional tooth loss and infection cats like dogs are digitigrades they walk directly on their toes with the bones of their feet making up the lower part of the visible leg cats are capable of walking very precisely because like all felines they directly register that is they place each hind paw directly in the print of the corresponding fore paw minimizing noise and visible tracks this also provides sure footing for their hind paws when they navigate rough terrain unlike most mammals when cats walk they use a pacing gait that is they move the two legs on one side of the body before the legs on the other side this trait is shared with camels and giraffes as a walk speeds up into a trot a cats gait changes to be a diagonal gait similar to that of most other mammals the diagonally opposite hind and fore legs move simultaneously like almost all members of the felidae cats have protractable and retractable claws in their normal relaxed position the claws are sheathed with the skin and fur around the paws toe pads this keeps the claws sharp by preventing wear from contact with the ground and allows the silent stalking of prey the claws on the fore feet are typically sharper than those on the hind feet cats can voluntarily extend their claws on one or more paws they may extend their claws in hunting or selfdefense climbing kneading kneading or for extra traction on soft surfaces most cats have five claws on their front paws and four on their rear paws the fifth front claw is proximal to the other claws more proximally is a protrusion which appears to be a sixth finger this special feature of the front paws on the inside of the wrists is the carpal pad also found on the paws of big cats and dogs it has no function in normal walking but is thought to be an antiskidding device used while jumping some breeds of cats are prone to polydactyl catpolydactyly these are particularly common along the northeast coast of north america cats are familiar and easily kept animals and their physiology has been particularly well studied it generally resembles those of other carnivorous mammals but displays several unusual features probably attributable to cats descent from desertdwelling species for instance cats are able to tolerate quite high temperatures humans generally start to feel uncomfortable when their skin temperature passes about but cats show no discomfort until their skin reaches around and can tolerate temperatures of up to if they have access to water class floatright textalignleft margin10px

body parts of a cat cats conserve heat by reducing the flow of blood to their skin and lose heat by evaporation through their mouths cats have minimal ability to sweat with glands located primarily in their paw pads and thermoregulationendothermypant for heat relief only at very high temperatures a cats body temperature does not vary throughout the day this is part of cats general lack of circadian rhythms and may reflect their tendency to be active both during the day and at night cats feces are comparatively dry and their urine is highly concentrated both of which are adaptations to allow cats to retain as much water as possible their kidneys are so efficient they can survive on a diet consisting only of meat with no additional water and can even rehydrate by drinking seawater while domestic cats are able to swim they are generally reluctant to enter water as it quickly leads to exhaustion cats are obligate carnivores their physiology has evolved to efficiently process meat and they have difficulty digesting plant matter in contrast to omnivores such as rats which only require about 4 protein in their diet about 20 of a cats diet must be protein cats are unusually dependent on a constant supply of the amino acid arginine and a diet lacking arginine causes marked weight loss and can be rapidly fatal another unusual feature is that the cat cannot produce taurine with taurine deficiency causing macular degeneration wherein the cats retina slowly degenerates causing irreversible blindness a cats gut gastrointestinal tract is adapted to meat eating being much shorter than that of omnivores and having low levels of several of the digestive enzymes needed to digest carbohydrates these traits severely limit the cats ability to digest and use plantderived nutrients as well as certain fatty acids despite the cats meatoriented physiology several vegetarian or vegan cat foods have been marketed that are supplemented with chemical synthesischemically synthesized taurine and other nutrients in attempts to produce a complete diet however some of these products still fail to provide all the nutrients cats require and diets containing no animal products pose the risk of causing severe nutritional deficiencies however vets in the united states have expressed concern that many domestic cats are overfed cats do eat grass occasionally a proposed explanation is that cats use grass as a source of folic acid another proposed explanation is that it is used to supply dietary fiber helping the cat defecate more easily and expel parasites and other harmful material through feces and vomit imagetapetumlucidumjpgthumbleftreflection of camera flash from the tapetum lucidum cats have excellent night vision and can see at only onesixth the light level required for human vision this is partly the result of cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum which reflects any light that passes through the retina back into the eye thereby increasing the eyes sensitivity to dim light another adaptation to dim light is the large pupils of cats eyes unlike some big cats such as tigers domestic cats have pupilin other animalsslit pupils these slit pupils can focus bright light without chromatic aberration and are needed since the domestic cats pupils are much larger relative to their eyes than the pupils of the big cats at low light levels a cats pupils will expand to cover most of the exposed surface of its eyes however domestic cats have rather poor color vision and have only two types of cone cellcones optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green they have limited ability to distinguish between red and green a 1993 paper reported a response to middle wavelengths from a system other than the rod cellrods which might be due to a third type of cone however this appears to be an adaptation to low light levels rather than representing true trichromatic vision cats have excellent hearing and can detect an extremely broad range of frequencies they can hear higherpitched sounds than either dogs or humans detecting frequencies from 55nbsphz to 79000nbsphz a range of 105nbspoctaves while humans and dogs both have ranges of about 9nbspoctaves cats can hear ultrasound which is important in hunting because many species of rodents make ultrasonic calls however they do not communicate using ultrasound like rodents do cats hearing is also sensitive and among the best of any mammal being most acute in the range of 500nbsphz to 32nbspkhz this sensitivity is further enhanced by the cats large movable outer ears pinnae which both amplify sounds and help detect the direction of a noise cats have an acute sense of smell due in part to their welldeveloped olfactory bulb and a large surface of olfactory mucosa about in area which is about twice that of humans cats are sensitive to cat pheromonepheromones such as 3mercapto3methylbutan1ol which they use to communicate through urine spraying and marking with scent glands many cats also respond strongly to plants that contain nepetalactone especially catnip as they can detect that substance at less than one part per billion about 7080 of cats are affected by nepetalactone this response is also produced by other plants such as silver vine and the herb valerian valerian it may be caused by the smell of these plants mimicking a pheromone and stimulating cats social or sexual behaviors cats have relatively few taste buds compared to humans domestic and wild cats share a gene mutation that keeps their sweet taste buds from binding to sugary molecules leaving them with no ability to taste sweetness their taste buds instead respond to amino acids bitter tastes and acids cats and many other animals have a jacobsons organ located in their mouths that allows them to tastesmell certain aromas in a way of which humans have no experience cats also have a distinct temperature preference for their food preferring food with a temperature around which is similar to that of a fresh kill and routinely rejecting food presented cold or refrigerated filekittyply edit1jpgthumbrightthe whiskers of a cat are highly sensitive to touch to aid with navigation and sensation cats have dozens of movable whiskers over their body especially their faces these provide information on the width of gaps and on the location of objects in the dark both by touching objects directly and by sensing air currents they also trigger protective blink reflexes to protect the eyes from damage most breeds of cat have a noted fondness for settling in high places or perching in the wild a higher place may serve as a concealed site from which to hunt domestic cats may strike prey by pouncing from a perch such as a tree branch as does a leopard another possible explanation is that height gives the cat a better observation point allowing it to survey its territory during a fall from a high place a cat can reflexively twist its body and right itself using its acute sense of balance and flexibility this is known as the cat righting reflex an individual cat always rights itself in the same way provided it has the time to do so during a fall the height required for this to occur is around cats without a tail manx cats also have this ability since a cat mostly moves its hind legs and relies on conservation of angular momentum to set up for landing and the tail is little used for this feat the average lifespan of pet cats has risen in recent years in the early 1980s it was about seven years rising to 94 years in 1995 and 1215 years in 2014 however cats have been reported as surviving into their 30s example with the oldest known cat creme puff creme puff dying at a verified age of 38 spaying or neutering increases life expectancy one study found neutered male cats live twice as long as intact males while spayed female cats live 62 longer than intact females having a cat neutered confers health benefits because castrated males cannot develop testicular cancer spayed females cannot develop uterine canceruterine or ovarian cancer and both have a reduced risk of mammary tumormammary cancer despite widespread concern about the welfare of freeroaming cats the lifespans of neutered feral cats in managed colonies compare favorably with those of pet cats diseases a wide range of health problems may affect cats including infectious diseases parasites injuries and chronic disease feline vaccinationvaccinations are available for many of these diseases and domestic cats are regularly given treatments to eliminate parasites such as worms and fleas poisoning in addition to obvious dangers such as rodenticides insecticides and herbicides cats may be poisoned by many chemicals usually considered safe by their human guardians because their livers are less effective at some forms of detoxification than those of many other animals including humans and dogs some of the most common causes of poisoning in cats are antifreeze and rodent baits cats may be particularly sensitive to environmental pollutants when a cat has a sudden or prolonged serious illness without any obvious cause it has possibly been exposed to a toxin many human medicines should never be given to cats for example the painkiller paracetamol tylenol and panadol panadol is extremely toxic to cats even very small doses need immediate treatment and can be fatal even aspirin which is sometimes used to treat arthritis in cats is much more toxic to them than to humans and must be administered cautiously similarly application of minoxidil to the skin of cats either accidentally or by wellmeaning guardians attempting to counter loss of fur has sometimes been fatal essential oils can be toxic to cats and cases have been reported of serious illnesses caused by tea tree oil including flea treatments and shampoos containing it other common household substances that should be used with caution around cats include mothballs and other naphthalene products phenolbased products are often used for cleaning and disinfecting near cats feeding areas or litter boxes but these can sometimes be fatal ethylene glycol often used as an automotive antifreeze is particularly appealing to cats and as little as a teaspoonful can be fatal some human foods are toxic to cats for example chocolate can cause theobromine poisoning although few cats will eat chocolate large amounts of onions or garlic are also poisonous to cats many houseplants are also dangerous such as philodendron species and the leaves of the easter lily which can cause permanent and lifethreatening kidney damage the domesticated cat and its closest wild ancestor are both diploid organisms that possess 38 chromosomes and roughly 20000 genes about 250 heritable genetic disorders have been identified in cats many similar to human inborn error of metabolisminborn errors the high level of similarity among the metabolism of mammals allows many of these feline diseases to be diagnosed using genetic testinggenetic tests that were originally developed for use in humans as well as the use of cats as animal models in the study of the human diseases behavior fileblack white cat on fencejpgalt sociability communication grooming fighting hunting and feeding play 4alt reproduction habitats feral cats impact on prey species impact on birds 3101986 cats may bite humans when provoked during play or when aggressive complications from cat bites can develop a cat bite differs from the bites of other pets this is because the teeth of a cat are sharp and pointed causing deep punctures skin usually closes rapidly over the bite and traps microorganisms that cause infection cats can be infected or infested with viruses pathogenic bacteriabacteria fungus protozoans arthropods or worms that can transmit diseases to humans in some cases the cat exhibits no symptoms of the disease however the same disease can then become evident in a human the likelihood that a person will become diseased depends on the age and immunity immune status of the person humans who have cats living in their home or in close association are more likely to become infected however those who do not keep cats as pets might also acquire infections from cat feces and parasites exiting the cats body some of the infections of most concern include salmonella cat scratch disease and toxoplasmosis filepsm v37 d105 english tabby catjpgthumbrighta 19th century drawing of a tabby cat traditionally historians tended to think ancient egypt was the site of cat domestication owing to the clear depictions of house cats in egyptian paintings about 3600 years old however in 2004 a neolithic grave excavated in shillourokambos cyprus contained the skeletons laid close to one another of both a human and a cat the grave is estimated to be 9500 years old pushing back the earliest known felinehuman association significantly the cat specimen is large and closely resembles the african wildcat rather than presentday domestic cats this discovery combined with genetic studies suggests cats were probably domesticated in the middle east in the fertile crescent around the time of the history of agriculturedevelopment of agriculture and then were brought to cyprus and egypt direct evidence for the domestication of cats 5300 years ago in quanhucun china has been published by archaeologists and paleontologists from the university of washington and chinese academy of sciences the cats are believed to have been attracted to the village by rodents which in turn were attracted by grain cultivated and stored by humans in ancient egypt cats were animal worshipsacred animals with the goddess bastet often depicted in cat form sometimes taking on the warlike aspect of a lioness the ancient romeromans are often credited with introducing the domestic cat from egypt to europe in gallia aquitaniaroman aquitaine a first or secondcentury engraving of a young girl holding a cat is one of two earliest depictions of the roman domesticated cat however cats possibly were already kept in europe prior to the roman empire as they may have been present in britain in the late iron age domestic cats were spread throughout much of the rest of the world during the age of discovery as ships cats were carried on sailing ships to control shipboard rodents and as goodluck charms several ancient religions believed cats are exalted souls companions or guides for humans that are allknowing but mute so they cannot influence decisions made by humans in japan the maneki neko cat is a symbol of good fortune although no species are sacred in islam islam and catscats are revered by muslims some western writers have stated muhammad had a favorite cat muezza he is reported to have loved cats so much he would do without his cloak rather than disturb one that was sleeping on it the story has no origin in early muslim writers and seems to confuse a story of a later sufi saint ahmed arrifai centuries after muhammad freyja the goddess of love beauty and fertility in norse mythology is depicted as riding a chariot drawn by cats superstitions and cat burning many cultures have negative superstitions about cats an example would be the belief that a black cat crossing ones path leads to bad luck or that cats are witches familiar spiritfamiliars used to augment a witchs powers and skills the killing of cats in medieval ypres belgium is commemorated in the innocuous presentday kattenstoet in medieval france cats would be burnt alive as a form of entertainment according to norman davies the assembled
