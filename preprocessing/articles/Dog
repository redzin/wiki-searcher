The '''domestic dog''' (''Canis lupus familiaris'' or ''Canis familiaris'')&lt;ref name=wang2008/&gt; is a member of genus ''[[Canis]]'' (canines) that forms part of the [[Evolution of the wolf#Wolf-like canids|wolf-like canids]],&lt;ref name=lindblad2005/&gt; and is the most widely abundant [[carnivore]].&lt;ref name=fan2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=thalmann2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=vila1999/&gt; The dog and the extant [[gray wolf]] are sister [[taxa]],&lt;ref name=vila1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=freedman2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt; with modern wolves not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated,&lt;ref name=freedman2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt; which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct.&lt;ref name=vonholdt2016/&gt; The dog was the first [[domestication|domesticated]] species&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=perri2016/&gt; and has been [[selective breeding|selectively bred]] over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADW&quot;/&gt;

==Etymology==
The term &quot;domestic dog&quot; is generally used for both [[domesticated]] and [[feral]] varieties. The English word ''dog'' comes from [[Middle English]] ''dogge'', from [[Old English]] ''[[wikt:docga|docga]]'', a &quot;powerful dog breed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclocenter.com/Domestic-Pet-134.html |title=Domestic PetDog Classified By Linnaeus In 1758 As Canis Familiaris And Canis Familiarus Domesticus |publisher=www.encyclocentral.com |accessdate=18 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521193821/http://www.encyclocenter.com/Domestic-Pet-134.html |archivedate=21 May 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term may possibly derive from Proto-Germanic ''*dukkōn'', represented in Old English ''finger-docce'' (&quot;finger-muscle&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Seebold|first = Elmar|title = Kluge.

In 14th-century England, ''[[hound]]'' (from {{lang-ang|hund}}) was the general word for all domestic canines, and ''dog'' referred to a subtype of hound, a group including the mastiff. It is believed this &quot;dog&quot; type was so common, it eventually became the prototype of the category &quot;hound&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;dog&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Broz|first = Vlatko|title = Diachronic Investigations of False Friends|journal=Contemporary Linguistics (Suvremena lingvistika)|volume = 66|issue = 2|pages = 199–222|year = 2008|url = http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=48370&amp;lang=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 16th century, ''dog'' had become the general word, and ''hound'' had begun to refer only to types used for hunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=René Dirven|author2=Marjolyn Verspoor|title=Cognitive exploration of language and linguistics|year=2004|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=978-90-272-1906-0|pages=215–216|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uZcs6poXkfEC&amp;pg=PA215}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word &quot;hound&quot; is ultimately derived from the Proto-Indo-European word ''*kwon-'', &quot;dog&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE259.html| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061018073726/http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE259.html| archivedate = 18 October 2006| title = The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition| accessdate =30 November 2006| publisher=www.bartleby.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This semantic shift may be compared with in German, where the corresponding words ''Dogge'' and ''Hund'' kept their original meanings. The term ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/ḱwṓ|*ḱwon-]]'' may ultimately derive from the earliest layer of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] vocabulary.&lt;ref name=&quot;MALLORY119&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Mallory, J.

A male canine is referred to as a &quot;dog&quot;, while a female is called a &quot;bitch&quot; (derived from Middle English ''bicche'', from Old English ''bicce'', ultimately from Old Norse ''bikkja''). The father of a [[litter (animal)|litter]] is called the ''sire'', and the mother is called the ''dam''. The process of birth is &quot;whelping&quot;, from the Old English word ''hwelp''; the modern English word &quot;whelp&quot; is an alternative term for puppy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Gould, Jean |title=All about dog breeding for quality and soundness |publisher=Pelham |location=London, Eng |year=1978 |isbn=0-7207-1064-2}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A litter refers to the multiple offspring at one birth which are called [[Puppy|puppies]] or pups from the French ''poupée'', &quot;doll&quot;, which has mostly replaced the older term &quot;whelp&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/dog |title=Dog |publisher=[[Dictionary.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
*The term ''dog'' typically is applied both to the species (or subspecies) as a whole, and any adult male member of the same.
*An adult female is a ''bitch''. In some countries, especially in North America, ''dog'' is used instead due to the vulgar connotation of ''bitch''.
*An adult male capable of reproduction is a ''stud''.
*An adult female capable of reproduction is a ''brood bitch'', or ''brood mother''.
*Immature males or females (that is, animals that are incapable of reproduction) are ''pups'' or ''puppies''.
*A group of pups from the same [[gestation period]] is a ''litter''.
*The father of a litter is a ''sire''. It is possible for one litter to have multiple sires.
*The mother of a litter is a ''dam''.
*A group of any three or more adults is a ''pack''.

==Taxonomy==
In 1758, the taxonomist [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] published in his ''[[10th edition of Systema Naturae|Systema Naturae]]'' the classification of species. ''[[Canis]]'' is a Latin word meaning dog,&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|canine}}&lt;/ref&gt; and under this [[genus]] he listed the dog-like carnivores including domestic dogs, wolves, and jackals. He classified the domestic dog as ''Canis familiaris'' (Linnaeus, 1758) and on the next page as a separate species he classified the [[wolf]] as ''Canis lupus'' (Linnaeus, 1758).&lt;ref name=linnaeus1758/&gt; In 1926, the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN) ruled in Opinion 91 that the domestic dog ''Canis familiaris'' (Linnaeus, 1758) be placed on its official list.&lt;ref name=iczn1926/&gt; In 1957, the ICZN ruled in Opinion 451 that ''Canis dingo'' (Meyer, 1793) was the name to be used for the [[dingo]] and that this be placed on its official list.&lt;ref name=iczn1957/&gt; These are the [[scientific names]] for the dog and dingo that appear on the ''Official Lists and Indexes of Names in Zoology'' of the ICZN.&lt;ref name=iczn2014/&gt;

In 1978, a review to reduce the number species listed under genus ''Canis'' proposed that &quot;''Canis dingo'' is now generally regarded as a distinctive feral domestic dog. ''Canis familiaris'' is used for domestic dogs, although taxonomically it should probably be synonymous with ''Canis lupus.''&quot;&lt;ref name=gelder1978/&gt; In 1982, the first edition of [[Mammal Species of the World]] included a note under ''Canis lupus'' with the comment: &quot;Probably ancestor of and conspecific with the domestic dog, ''familiaris''. ''Canis familiaris'' has page priority over ''Canis lupus'', but both were published simultaneously in Linnaeus (1758), and ''Canis lupus'' has been universally used for this species&quot;.&lt;ref name=honaki1982/&gt; In the same year, an application was made to the ICZN to reclassify the dingo to ''Canis lupus dingo'' because it was proposed that the wolf (''Canis lupus'') was the ancestor of dogs and dingoes, however the application was rejected.&lt;ref name=smith2015/&gt;

In 2003, the ICZN ruled in its [[Opinion 2027]] that the &quot;name of a wild species...is not invalid by virtue of being predated by the name based on a domestic form.&quot; Additionally, the ICZN placed the taxon ''Canis lupus'' as a [[conserved name]] on the official list under this opinion.&lt;ref name=iczn2003/&gt; In the third edition of ''[[Mammal Species of the World]]'' published in 2005, the mammalogist W. Christopher Wozencraft listed under the wolf ''Canis lupus'' what he proposed to be two subspecies: &quot;''familiaris'' Linneaus, 1758 [domestic dog]&quot; and &quot;''dingo'' Meyer, 1793 [domestic dog]&quot;,{{efn|The addition of [domestic dog] against ''dingo'' and ''familiaris'' is inferred to mean that these two taxons form the &quot;domestic dog clade&quot; within ''Canis lupus'', as opposed to its wild &quot;wolf clade&quot;.}} with the comment &quot;Includes the domestic dog as a subspecies, with the dingo provisionally separate – artificial variants created by domestication and selective breeding. Although this may stretch the subspecies concept, it retains the correct allocation of synonyms.&quot;&lt;ref name=wozencraft2005/&gt; Although the earliest use of the name &quot;dingo&quot; was ''Canis familiaris dingo'' (Blumenbach, 1780),&lt;ref name=blumenbach1780/&gt; Wozencraft attributed it to Meyer from 1793 without comment.&lt;ref name=itis2017/&gt;

This classification by Wozencraft is hotly debated by zoologists.&lt;ref name=smith2015/&gt; Mathew Crowther, Stephen Jackson and [[Colin Groves]] disagree with Wozencraft and argue that based on ICZN Opinion 2027, the implication is that a domestic animal cannot be a subspecies.&lt;ref name=jackson2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=crowther2014/&gt; Crowther, [[Juliet Clutton-Brock]] and others argue that because the dingo differs from wolves by behavior, morphology, and that the dingo and dog do not fall genetically within any extant wolf [[clade]], that the dingo should be considered the distinct taxon ''Canis dingo''.&lt;ref name=clutton2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=smith2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=crowther2014/&gt; Jackson and Groves regard the dog ''Canis familiaris'' as a [[taxonomic synonym]] for the wolf ''Canis lupus'' with them both equally ranked at the species level. They also disagree with Crowther, based on the overlap between dogs and dingoes in their morphology, in their ability to easily hybridize with each other, and that they show the signs of domestication by both having a cranium of smaller capacity than their progenitor, the wolf. Given that ''Canis familiaris'' (Linnaeus, 1758) has date priority over ''Canis dingo'' (Meyer, 1793), they regard the dingo as a  [[Synonym (taxonomy)#zoology|junior taxonomic synonym]] for the dog ''Canis familiaris''.&lt;ref name=jackson2015/&gt; [[Gheorghe Benga]] and others support the dingo as a subspecies of the dog from the earlier ''Canis familiaris dingo'' (Blumenbach, 1780).&lt;ref name=benga2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=elledge2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=jones1925/&gt; [[Xiaoming Wang]] and [[Richard H. Tedford]] proposed that the dog should be classified as ''Canis lupus familiaris'' under the [[Biological Species Concept]] and ''Canis familiaris'' under the [[Evolutionary developmental biology|Evolutionary Species Concept]].&lt;ref name=wang2008/&gt;

==Origin==
{{Main article|Origin of the domestic dog}}

&lt;!--Note: What is reflected in this section must be in accord with what is on the &quot;Origin of the domestic dog&quot; page and the &quot;Gray wolf&quot; page (sub-heading &quot;Evolution and relationship with the dog&quot;). Unless you have some subject knowledge on the topic, please don't tinker – if you are dog-kind then take your concerns to the &quot;Origin of the domestic dog&quot; Talk page, or wolf-kind take it to the &quot;Gray wolf&quot; Talk page&amp;nbsp;– all of your queries will be eventually answered.--&gt;
The origin of the domestic dog is not clear. It is known that the dog was the first domesticated species.&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=perri2016/&gt; The domestic dog is a member of genus ''[[Canis]]'' (canines) that forms part of the [[Evolution of the wolf#Wolf-like canids|wolf-like canids]].&lt;ref name=lindblad2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=fan2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=thalmann2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=vila1999/&gt; The closest living relative of the dog is the [[gray wolf]] and there is no evidence of any other canine contributing to its genetic lineage.&lt;ref name=fan2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=thalmann2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=vonholdt2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=vila1997/&gt; The dog and the [[wikt:extant|extant]] gray wolf form two sister [[clades]],&lt;ref name=vila1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=freedman2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt; with modern wolves not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated.&lt;ref name=freedman2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt; The archaeological record shows the first undisputed dog remains buried beside humans 14,700 years ago,&lt;ref name=giemsch2015/&gt; with disputed remains occurring 36,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=germonpre2009/&gt;  These dates imply that the earliest dogs arose in the time of human [[hunter-gatherers]] and not [[agriculturists]].&lt;ref name=thalmann2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=freedman2014/&gt; 

Where the [[genetic divergence]] of dog and wolf took place remains controversial, with the most plausible proposals spanning Western Europe,&lt;ref name=machugh2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=thalmann2013/&gt; Central Asia,&lt;ref name=machugh2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=shannon2015/&gt; and East Asia.&lt;ref name=machugh2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=wang2015/&gt; This has been made more complicated by the most recent proposal that fits the available evidence, which is that an initial wolf population split into East and West Eurasian wolves, these were then domesticated independently before going extinct into two distinct dog populations between 14,000-6,400 years ago, and then the Western Eurasian dog population was partially and gradually replaced by East Asian dogs that were brought by humans at least 6,400 years ago.&lt;ref name=machugh2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=frantz2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=grimm2016/&gt;

===Anatomy===
{{main article|Dog anatomy}}

Domestic dogs have been selectively bred for millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADW&quot;/&gt; Modern [[dog breed]]s show more variation in size, appearance, and behavior than any other domestic animal.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADW&quot;/&gt; Dogs are [[predation|predators]] and [[scavenger]]s, and like many other predatory mammals, the dog has powerful muscles, fused wrist bones, a cardiovascular system that supports both sprinting and endurance, and teeth for catching and tearing.

====Size and weight====
Dogs are highly variable in height and weight. The smallest known adult dog was a [[Yorkshire Terrier]], that stood only {{convert|6.3|cm|abbr=on}} at the shoulder, {{convert|9.5|cm|abbr=on}} in length along the head-and-body, and weighed only {{convert|113|g}}. The largest known dog was an [[English Mastiff]] which weighed {{convert|155.6|kg|abbr=on}} and was {{convert|250|cm|abbr=on}} from the snout to the tail.&lt;ref name=&quot;zorba&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldslargestdog1.com/zorba2/|title=World's Largest Dog|accessdate=7 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tallest dog is a [[Great Dane]] that stands {{convert|106.7|cm|abbr=on}} at the shoulder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records/natural_world/fantastic_pets/tallest_dog_living.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711133443/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records/natural_world/fantastic_pets/tallest_dog_living.aspx |archivedate=11 July 2011 |title=Guinness World Records – Tallest Dog Living |accessdate=7 January 2009 |publisher=Guinness World Records |date=31 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Coat====
{{Main article|Coat (dog)}}
[[File:Dog coat variation.png|thumb|Montage showing the coat variation of the dog.]]
[[File:Golden Retriever medium-to-light-coat.jpg|thumb|A [[Golden Retriever]] with a golden shade of coat. Shades of coat colors can vary between breeds of dogs. For example, some Golden Retrievers have light, almost cream colored coats, and others may have dark, brownish shades of coat. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/golden-retriever/detail/#tone|title=Golden Retriever History &amp; Training/Temperament|last=Club|first=American Kennel|work=American Kennel Club|access-date=2017-09-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[pelage|coats]] of domestic dogs are of two varieties: &quot;double&quot; being common with dogs (as well as wolves) originating from colder climates, made up of a coarse [[guard hair]] and a soft [[down hair]], or &quot;single&quot;, with the topcoat only.

Domestic dogs often display the remnants of [[countershading]], a common natural camouflage pattern. A countershaded animal will have dark coloring on its upper surfaces and light coloring below,&lt;ref name=&quot;About.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animals.about.com/od/zoology12/f/countershading.htm|title=What is Counter Shading?|last= Klappenbach|first=Laura|year=2008|publisher=About.com|accessdate=22 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; which reduces its general visibility. Thus, many breeds will have an occasional &quot;blaze&quot;, stripe, or &quot;star&quot; of white fur on their chest or underside.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia of Dog Breeds&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cunliffe|first=Juliette|title=The Encyclopedia of Dog Breeds|publisher=Paragon Publishing|year=2004|pages=20–23|chapter=Coat Types, Colours and Markings|isbn=0-7525-8276-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tail====
{{See also|Docking (dog)|label 1=Docking}}
There are many different shapes for [[dog tail]]s: straight, straight up, sickle, curled, or cork-screw. As with many canids, one of the primary functions of a dog's tail is to communicate their emotional state, which can be important in getting along with others. In some hunting dogs, however, the tail is traditionally [[docking (dog)|docked]] to avoid injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdb.org/case4dock.htm|title=The Case for Tail Docking|publisher=Council of Docked Breeds|accessdate=22 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some breeds, such as the [[Braque du Bourbonnais]], puppies can be born with a short tail or no tail at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.braquedubourbonnais.info/en/tail-genetics.htm |title=Bourbonnais pointer or 'short tail pointer' |publisher=Braquedubourbonnais.info |accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
{{Main article|Dog health}}
There are many household plants that are poisonous to dogs including [[begonia]], [[Poinsettia]] and [[aloe vera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunset.com/garden/flowers-plants/plants-poisonous-to-dogs-00418000068562/|title=Plants poisonous to dogs – Sunset|work=Sunset}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some breeds of dogs are prone to certain genetic ailments such as [[Elbow dysplasia|elbow]] and [[hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]], [[blindness]], [[deafness]], [[pulmonary valve stenosis|pulmonic stenosis]], [[cleft lip and palate|cleft palate]], and [[luxating patella|trick knees]]. Two serious medical conditions particularly affecting dogs are [[pyometra]], affecting [[neutering|unspayed]] females of all types and ages, and [[gastric dilatation volvulus]] (bloat), which affects the larger breeds or deep-chested dogs. Both of these are acute conditions, and can kill rapidly. Dogs are also susceptible to parasites such as [[flea]]s, [[tick]]s, and [[mite]]s, as well as [[hookworms]], [[tapeworms]], [[roundworms]], and [[Dirofilaria immitis|heartworms]].

A number of common human foods and household ingestibles are toxic to dogs, including [[chocolate|chocolate solids]] ([[theobromine poisoning]]), onion and [[garlic]] ([[thiosulphate]], [[sulfoxide]] or [[disulfide]] poisoning),&lt;ref&gt;Sources vary on which of these are considered the most significant toxic item.&lt;/ref&gt; [[grape]]s and [[raisin]]s, [[macadamia nut]]s, [[xylitol]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Murphy | first1 = L.

Dogs can be exposed to the substance by scavenging garbage or ashtrays; eating cigars and cigarettes. Signs can be vomiting of large amounts (e.g., from eating cigar butts) or diarrhea. Some other signs are abdominal pain, loss of coordination, collapse, or death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fogle |first=Bruce |authorlink=Bruce Fogle |year=1974 |title=Caring For Your Dog}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dogs are highly susceptible to [[theobromine poisoning]], typically from ingestion of [[chocolate]]. Theobromine is toxic to dogs because, although the dog's metabolism is capable of breaking down the chemical, the process is so slow that even small amounts of chocolate can be fatal, especially dark chocolate.

Dogs are also vulnerable to some of the same health conditions as humans, including [[diabetes in dogs|diabetes]], dental and heart disease, epilepsy, cancer, hypothyroidism, and arthritis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dogtime.com/diseases-shared-by-humans-pets-ernie-ward.html|title=Diseases shared by humans and pets|author=Ward, Ernie|publisher=Dogtime.com|accessdate=2 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lifespan====
[[File:Terrier mixed-breed dog.jpg|thumb|left|A mixed-breed terrier. Mixed-breed dogs have been found to run faster and live longer than their pure-bred parents (See [[Heterosis#Heterosis in dogs|heterosis]])]]
In 2013, a study found that mixed breeds live on average 1.2 years longer than pure breeds, and that increasing body-weight was negatively correlated with longevity (i.e. the heavier the dog the shorter its lifespan).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = O'Neill | first1 = D.

{{Further|Aging in dogs}}

===Reproduction===
{{Main article|Canine reproduction}}
[[File:Säugende Hündin.JPG|thumb|Dog nursing newborn puppies]]
In domestic dogs, [[puberty|sexual maturity]] begins to happen around age six to twelve months for both males and females,&lt;ref name=&quot;ADW&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pets911.com/hosted/buffalo/puppy/article.php?num=11045|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610035254/http://www.pets911.com/hosted/buffalo/puppy/article.php?num=11045|archivedate=10 June 2009|title=Sexual Maturity&amp;nbsp;— Spay and Neuter|publisher=Buffalo.com|accessdate=22 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this can be delayed until up to two years old for some large breeds. This is the time at which female dogs will have their first [[estrous cycle]]. They will experience subsequent estrous cycles semiannually, during which the body prepares for [[pregnancy]]. At the peak of the cycle, females will come into estrus, being mentally and physically receptive to [[Canine tying|copulation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADW&quot;/&gt; Because the [[ovum|ova]] survive and are capable of being fertilized for a week after ovulation, it is possible for a female to mate with more than one male.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADW&quot;/&gt;

Fertilization typically occurs 2–5 days after ovulation; 14–16 days after ovulation, the embryo attaches to the uterus, and after 7-8 more days the heart beat is detectable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11787146 |year=2001 |last1=Concannon |first1=P |last2=Tsutsui |first2=T |last3=Shille |first3=V |title=Embryo development, hormonal requirements and maternal responses during canine pregnancy |volume=57 |pages=169–79 |journal=Journal of reproduction and fertility.

Dogs bear their litters roughly 58 to 68 days after [[fertilization]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ADW&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpvh.com/2011/07/27/gestation-in-dogs/ |title=Gestation in dogs |accessdate=24 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603145809/http://www.cpvh.com/2011/07/27/gestation-in-dogs/ |archivedate=3 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with an average of 63 days, although the length of gestation can vary. An average litter consists of about six [[puppy|puppies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/pet_overpopulation/facts/overpopulation_estimates.html|title=HSUS Pet Overpopulation Estimates|publisher=The Humane Society of the United States|accessdate=22 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this number may vary widely based on the breed of dog. In general, [[toy dog]]s produce from one to four puppies in each litter, while much larger breeds may average as many as twelve.

Some dog breeds have acquired traits through selective breeding that interfere with reproduction. Male [[French Bulldog]]s, for instance, are incapable of mounting the female. For many dogs of this breed, the female must be [[artificial insemination|artificially inseminated]] in order to reproduce.&lt;ref name=&quot;French&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frenchbulldog.org/2008/05/01/is-a-french-bulldog-the-right-breed-for-you/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726070030/http://www.frenchbulldog.org/2008/05/01/is-a-french-bulldog-the-right-breed-for-you/|archivedate=26 July 2011|title=French Bulldog Pet Care Guide|accessdate=7 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neutering====
[[File:Wilde huendin am stillen.jpg|right|thumb|A feral dog from [[Sri Lanka]] nursing her four puppies]]
[[Neutering]] refers to the [[Neutering|sterilization]] of animals, usually by [[Castration|removal of the male's testicle]]s or the female's [[ovary|ovaries]] and [[uterus]], in order to eliminate the ability to procreate and reduce [[sex drive]]. Because of the [[overpopulation in companion animals|overpopulation of dogs]] in some countries, many animal control agencies, such as the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] (ASPCA), advise that dogs not intended for further breeding should be neutered, so that they do not have undesired puppies that may have to later be euthanized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/spayneuter/ | title=Top 10 reasons to spay/neuter your pet | publisher=American Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals | accessdate =16 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Humane Society of the United States]], 3–4&amp;nbsp;million dogs and cats are [[euthanasia|put down]] each year in the United States and many more are confined to cages in shelters because there are many more animals than there are homes. Spaying or castrating dogs helps keep overpopulation down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | quote = Although the cause of pet overpopulation is multifaceted, the lack of guardians choosing to spay or neuter their animals is a major contributing factor. | last = Mahlow | first = Jane C. | year = 1999 | title = Estimation of the proportions of dogs and cats that are surgically sterilized | journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association | volume = 215 | pages = 640–643 | pmid= 10476708 | issue = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local humane societies, SPCAs, and other [[animal protection organizations]] urge people to neuter their pets and to adopt animals from shelters instead of purchasing them.

Neutering reduces problems caused by [[hypersexuality]], especially in male dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heidenberger |first=E |last2=Unshelm |first2=J |title=Changes in the behavior of dogs after castration |language=German |journal=Tierärztliche Praxis |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=69–75 |date=Feb 1990 |pmid=2326799 |issn=0303-6286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spayed female dogs are less likely to develop some forms of cancer, affecting mammary glands, ovaries, and other reproductive organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Morrison, Wallace B.|title=Cancer in Dogs and Cats (1st ed.)|publisher=Williams and Wilkins|year=1998|isbn=0-683-06105-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, neutering increases the risk of [[urinary incontinence]] in female dogs,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Arnold S |title=[Urinary incontinence in castrated bitches.

==Intelligence, behavior and communication==

===Intelligence===
{{Main article|Dog intelligence}}

Dog intelligence is the ability of the dog to perceive information and retain it as knowledge for applying to solve problems. Dogs have been shown to learn by inference. A study with [[Rico (Border Collie)|Rico]] showed that he knew the labels of over 200 different items. He inferred the names of novel items by exclusion learning and correctly retrieved those novel items immediately and also 4 weeks after the initial exposure. Dogs have advanced memory skills. A study documented the learning and memory capabilities of a border collie, &quot;Chaser&quot;, who had learned the names and could associate by verbal command over 1,000 words. Dogs are able to read and react appropriately to human body language such as gesturing and pointing, and to understand human voice commands. Dogs demonstrate a [[theory of mind]] by engaging in deception. An experimental study showed compelling evidence that Australian [[dingo]]s can outperform domestic dogs in non-social problem-solving, indicating that domestic dogs may have lost much of their original problem-solving abilities once they joined humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = B. | last2 = Litchfield | first2 = C. | year = 2010 | title = How well do dingoes (Canis dingo) perform on the detour task | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 80 | issue = | pages = 155–162 | doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.04.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study indicated that after undergoing training to solve a simple manipulation task, dogs that are faced with an insoluble version of the same problem look at the human, while socialized wolves do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(03)00263-X | pmid=12725735 | volume=13 | issue=9 | title=A simple reason for a big difference: wolves do not look back at humans, but dogs do | date=Apr 2003 | journal=Curr Biol | pages=763–6| author1=Miklósi | first1=A | last2=Kubinyi | first2=E | last3=Topál | first3=J | last4=Gácsi | first4=M | last5=Virányi | first5=Z | last6=Csányi | first6=V }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern domestic dogs use humans to solve their problems for them.&lt;ref name=hare2013/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/why-dogs-are-more-like-humans-than-wolves-22095590/?no-ist|title=Why Dogs are More Like Humans Than Wolves|author=Amy Crawford|work=Smithsonian|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Behavior===
{{Main article|Dog behavior}}

Dog behavior is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of the domestic dog (individuals or groups) to internal and/or external stimuli.&lt;ref name=levitis2009/&gt; As the oldest domesticated species, with estimates ranging from 9,000–30,000 years BCE, the minds of dogs inevitably have been shaped by millennia of contact with humans. As a result of this physical and social evolution, dogs, more than any other species, have acquired the ability to understand and communicate with humans, and they are uniquely attuned to human behaviors.&lt;ref name=berns2012/&gt; Behavioral scientists have uncovered a surprising set of social-cognitive abilities in the domestic dog. These abilities are not possessed by the dog's closest canine
relatives nor by other highly intelligent mammals such as great apes but rather parallel some of the social-cognitive skills of human children.&lt;ref name=tomasello2009/&gt; Traits of high sociability and lack of fear in dogs may include genetic modifications related to [[Williams-Beuren syndrome]] in humans, which cause [[hypersociability]] at the expense of problem solving ability.&lt;ref&gt;http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/7/e1700398.full&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication===
{{Main article|Dog communication}}

Dog communication is about how dogs &quot;speak&quot; to each other, how they understand messages that humans send to them, and how humans can translate the ideas that dogs are trying to transmit.&lt;ref&gt;Coren, Stanley &quot;How To Speak Dog: Mastering the Art of Dog-Human Communication&quot; 2000 Simon &amp; Schuster, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xii}} These communication behaviors include eye gaze, facial expression, vocalization, body posture (including movements of bodies and limbs) and gustatory communication (scents, pheromones and taste). Humans communicate with dogs by using vocalization, hand signals and body posture.

===Behavioral differences===
{{see also|Dog behavior#Behavior compared with other canids}}

Unlike other domestic species which were primarily selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Serpell J, Duffy D. Dog Breeds and Their Behavior. In: Domestic Dog Cognition and Behavior. Berlin, Heidelberg: Springer; 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cagan2016/&gt; In 2016, a study found that there were only 11 fixed genes that showed variation between wolves and dogs. These gene variations were unlikely to have been the result of natural evolution, and indicate selection on both morphology and behavior during dog domestication. These genes have been shown to affect the [[Catecholamine#Synthesis|catecholamine synthesis]] pathway, with the majority of the genes affecting the fight-or-flight response&lt;ref name=cagan2016/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Almada RC, Coimbra NC.

==Ecology==

===Population and habitat===
The global dog population is estimated at 900 million and rising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gompper |first=Matthew E. |year=2013 |chapter=The dog–human–wildlife interface: assessing the scope of the problem |title=Free-Ranging Dogs and Wildlife Conservation |editor-last=Gompper |editor-first=Matthew E. |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=9–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lescureaux2014/&gt; Although it is said that the [[Man's best friend (phrase)|&quot;dog is man's best friend&quot;]]&lt;ref name=&quot;J.

===Competitors===
Being the most abundant carnivore, feral and [[free-ranging dog]]s have the greatest potential to compete with wolves. A review of the studies in the competitive effects of dogs on [[Sympatry|sympatric]] carnivores did not mention any research on competition between dogs and wolves.&lt;ref name=lescureaux2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=vanak2014/&gt; Competition would favor the wolf that is known to kill dogs, however wolves tend to live in pairs or in small packs in areas where they are highly persecuted, giving them a disadvantage facing large dog groups.&lt;ref name=lescureaux2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=boitani1983/&gt;

Wolves kill dogs wherever the two canids occur.&lt;ref name=&quot;WOLVES&quot;/&gt; One survey claims that in Wisconsin in 1999 more compensation had been paid for dog losses than livestock, however in Wisconsin wolves will often kill hunting dogs, perhaps because they are in the wolf's territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;WOLVES&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Boitani, Luigi |author2=Mech, L.

In many cultures, there are strong social and emotional bonds between humans and their dogs that can be seen as family members or working team members. The loss of a dog can lead to strong emotional responses with demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.&lt;ref name=lescureaux2014/&gt;

[[Coyote]]s and big cats have also been known to attack dogs.

Dogs will healthily digest a variety of foods, including vegetables and grains, and can consume a large proportion of these in their diet, however all-meat diets are not recommended for dogs due to their lack of calcium and iron.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADW&quot;/&gt; Comparing dogs and wolves, dogs have adaptations in genes involved in starch digestion that contribute to an increased ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet.&lt;ref name=&quot;axelssonetal2013&quot;/&gt;

Most [[Dog breed|breeds]] of dog are at most a few hundred years old, having been artificially selected for particular [[morphology (biology)|morphologies]] and [[dog behavior|behaviors]] by people for specific functional roles.

==Roles with humans==
[[File:Gunnar Kaasen with Balto.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gunnar Kaasen]] and [[Balto]], the lead dog on the last relay team of the [[1925 serum run to Nome]].]]
Domestic dogs inherited complex behaviors, such as [[bite inhibition]], from their wolf ancestors, which would have been [[pack hunter]]s with complex body language. These sophisticated forms of social cognition and communication may account for their trainability, playfulness, and ability to fit into human households and social situations, and these attributes have given dogs a relationship with humans that has enabled them to become one of the most successful species on the planet today.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miklósi&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Miklósi, Adám |title=Dog Behaviour, Evolution, and Cognition|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KnVEIrVNGhIC|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-929585-2|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199295852.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pages95-136}}

The dogs' value to early human hunter-gatherers led to them quickly becoming ubiquitous across world cultures. Dogs perform many roles for people, such as [[hunting dog|hunting]], [[herding dog|herding]], [[sled dog|pulling loads]], [[guard dog|protection]], [[police dog|assisting police]] and [[Dogs in warfare|military]], [[pet|companionship]], and, more recently, [[service dog|aiding handicapped individuals]]. This influence on human society has given them the nickname &quot;[[Man's best friend (phrase)|man's best friend]]&quot; in the Western world. In some cultures, however, dogs [[#As a food source|are also a source of meat]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wingfield-Hayes&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Vietnam's dog meat tradition&quot;/&gt;

===Early roles===
Wolves, and their dog descendants, would have derived significant benefits from living in human camps—more safety, more reliable food, lesser caloric needs, and more chance to breed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Groves&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Groves |first= Colin |year= 1999|title= The Advantages and Disadvantages of Being Domesticated | journal=Perspectives in Human Biology|volume = 4| pages = 1–12 | issn = 1038-5762}}&lt;/ref&gt; They would have benefited from humans' upright gait that gives them larger range over which to see potential predators and prey, as well as better color vision that, at least by day, gives humans better visual discrimination.&lt;ref name=Groves/&gt; Camp dogs would also have benefited from human tool use, as in bringing down larger prey and [[control of fire|controlling fire]] for a range of purposes.&lt;ref name=Groves/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The dogs of [[Thibet]] are twice the size of those seen in India, with large heads and hairy bodies. They are powerful animals, and are said to be able to kill a tiger. During the day they are kept chained up, and are let loose at night to guard their masters' house.&lt;ref&gt;''Travels in Central Asia by Meer Izzut-oollah in the Years 1812-13''. Translated by Captain Henderson. Calcutta, 1872, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Humans would also have derived enormous benefit from the dogs associated with their camps.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tacon&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Paul |last1=Tacon |first2=Colin |last2=Pardoe |year=2002 |title=Dogs make us human |journal=Nature Australia |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=52–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, dogs would have improved sanitation by cleaning up food scraps.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tacon&quot;/&gt; Dogs may have provided warmth, as referred to in the Australian Aboriginal expression &quot;three dog night&quot; (an exceptionally cold night), and they would have alerted the camp to the presence of predators or strangers, using their acute hearing to provide an early warning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tacon&quot;/&gt;

There have been two major trends in the changing status of pet dogs. The first has been the 'commodification' of the dog, shaping it to conform to human expectations of personality and behaviour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Power&quot;/&gt; The second has been the broadening of the concept of the family and the home to include dogs-as-dogs within everyday routines and practices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Power&quot;/&gt;

The majority of contemporary people with dogs describe their pet as part of the family,&lt;ref name=&quot;Power&quot; /&gt; although some ambivalence about the relationship is evident in the popular reconceptualization of the dog–human family as a pack.&lt;ref name=&quot;Power&quot;/&gt; A [[dominance (ethology)|dominance]] model of dog–human relationships has been promoted by some dog trainers, such as on the television program ''[[Dog Whisperer]]''.

According to statistics published by the [[American Pet Products Manufacturers Association]] in the National Pet Owner Survey in 2009–2010, it is estimated there are 77.5&amp;nbsp;million people with pet dogs in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/pet_overpopulation/facts/pet_ownership_statistics.html| title=U.S. Pet Ownership Statistics|accessdate=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same survey shows nearly 40% of American households own at least one dog, of which 67% own just one dog, 25% two dogs and nearly 9% more than two dogs. There does not seem to be any gender preference among dogs as pets, as the statistical data reveal an equal number of female and male dog pets. Yet, although several programs are ongoing to promote [[pet adoption]], less than a fifth of the owned dogs come from a shelter.

The latest study using [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) comparing humans and dogs showed that dogs have same response to voices and use the same parts of the brain as humans do. This gives dogs the ability to recognize emotional human sounds, making them friendly social pets to humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/10653182/Dogs-and-humans-respond-to-voices-in-same-way.html |title=Dogs and humans respond to voices in same way |author=James Edgar |date=21 February 2014 |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People often enter their dogs in competitions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/events/conformation/beginners.cfm|title=A Beginner's Guide to Dog Shows|publisher=American Kennel Club|accessdate=30 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as breed-conformation shows or [[list of dog sports|sports]], including racing, sledding and agility competitions.

In conformation shows, also referred to as breed shows, a judge familiar with the specific dog breed evaluates individual purebred dogs for conformity with their established breed type as described in the breed standard. As the breed standard only deals with the externally observable qualities of the dog (such as appearance, movement, and temperament), separately tested qualities (such as ability or health) are not part of the judging in conformation shows.

In Korea, the primary dog breed raised for meat, the ''[[nureongi]]'' (누렁이), differs from those breeds raised for pets that Koreans may keep in their homes.&lt;ref name=&quot;pettid&quot;&gt;Pettid, Michael J., Korean Cuisine: An Illustrated History, London: Reaktion Books Ltd., 2008, 25. {{ISBN|1-86189-348-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most popular Korean dog dish is ''[[bosintang|gaejang-guk]]'' (also called ''bosintang''), a spicy stew meant to balance the body's heat during the summer months; followers of the custom claim this is done to ensure good health by balancing one's ''[[Qi|gi]]'', or vital energy of the body. A 19th century version of ''gaejang-guk'' explains that the dish is prepared by boiling dog meat with [[scallion]]s and chili powder. Variations of the dish contain chicken and bamboo shoots. While the dishes are still popular in Korea with a segment of the population, dog is not as widely consumed as beef, chicken, and pork.&lt;ref name=&quot;pettid&quot;/&gt;

===Health benefits for humans===

A 2005 paper states &quot;recent research has failed to support earlier findings that pet ownership is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, a reduced use of general practitioner services, or any psychological or physical benefits on health for community dwelling older people. Research has, however, pointed to significantly less absenteeism from school through sickness among children who live with pets.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pet ownership and human health: a brief review of evidence and issues&quot;/&gt; In one study, new guardians reported a highly significant reduction in minor health problems during the first month following pet acquisition, and this effect was sustained in those with dogs through to the end of the study.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated717&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Serpell J |title=Beneficial effects of pet ownership on some aspects of human health and behaviour |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=84 |issue=12 |pages=717–20 |year=1991 |pmid=1774745 |pmc=1295517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, people with pet dogs took considerably more physical exercise than those with cats and those without pets. The results provide evidence that keeping pets may have positive effects on human health and behaviour, and that for guardians of dogs these effects are relatively long-term.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated717&quot;/&gt; Pet guardianship has also been associated with increased coronary artery disease survival, with human guardians being significantly less likely to die within one year of an acute myocardial infarction than those who did not own dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Friedmann E, Thomas SA |title=Pet ownership, social support, and one-year survival after acute myocardial infarction in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) |journal=The American Journal of Cardiology |volume=76 |issue=17 |pages=1213–7 |year=1995 |pmid=7502998 |doi=10.1016/S0002-9149(99)80343-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The health benefits of dogs can result from contact with dogs in general, and not solely from having dogs as pets. For example, when in the presence of a pet dog, people show reductions in cardiovascular, behavioral, and psychological indicators of anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1097/00005053-199108000-00006 |author=Wilson CC |title=The pet as an anxiolytic intervention |journal=The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease |volume=179 |issue=8 |pages=482–9 |year=1991 |pmid=1856711}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other health benefits are gained from exposure to immune-stimulating microorganisms, which, according to the [[hygiene hypothesis]], can protect against allergies and autoimmune diseases. The benefits of contact with a dog also include social support, as dogs are able to not only provide companionship and social support themselves, but also to act as facilitators of social interactions between humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=McNicholas |first1=J. |last2=Collis |first2=G.

===Medical detection dogs===
Medical detection dogs are capable of detecting diseases by sniffing a person directly or samples of urine or other specimens. Dogs can detect odour in one part per trillion, as their brain's olfactory cortex is (relative to total brain size) 40 times larger than humans. Dogs may have as many as 300 million odour receptors in their nose, while humans may have only 5 million. Each dog is trained specifically for the detection of single disease from the blood glucose level indicative to diabetes to cancer. The process of training a cancer dog requires six months. A [[Labrador Retriever]] called Daisy has detected 551 cancer patients with an accuracy of 93 percent and received the [[Blue Cross (animal charity)|Blue Cross]] (for pets) Medal for her life-saving skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/telegraphchristmasappeal/11241191/How-my-dog-sniffed-out-breast-cancer-and-saved-my-life.html |title=How my dog sniffed out breast cancer and saved my lifeYYY |author=Terry Gasking |accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2843349/Medal-heroic-dog-sniffed-owner-s-cancer-Daisy-Labrador-helped-disease-551-patients.html |title=Medal for the heroic dog who sniffed out her owner's cancer: Daisy the Labrador has helped find disease in 551 patients |date=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dogs have been viewed and represented in different manners by different cultures and religions, over the course of history.

===Mythology===
{{see also|Category:Mythological dogs}}

In mythology, dogs often serve as pets or as watchdogs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherman2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Sherman, Josepha |title=Storytelling: An Encyclopedia of Mythology and Folklore|date=August 2008|publisher=Sharpe Reference|isbn=978-0-7656-8047-1|pages=118–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Greek mythology]], [[Cerberus]] is a three-headed watchdog who guards the gates of [[Hades]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherman2008&quot;/&gt; In [[Norse mythology]], a bloody, four-eyed dog called [[Garmr]] guards [[Helheim]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherman2008&quot;/&gt; In [[Persian mythology]], two four-eyed dogs guard the [[Chinvat Bridge]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherman2008&quot;/&gt; In [[Philippine mythology]], Kimat who is the pet of [[Tadaklan]], god of thunder, is responsible for lightning. In [[Welsh mythology]], [[Annwn]] is guarded by [[Cŵn Annwn]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherman2008&quot;/&gt;

In [[Hindu mythology]], [[Yama]], the god of death owns two watch dogs who have four eyes. They are said to watch over the gates of [[Naraka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/iml/iml08.htm |title=Indian Myth and Legend: Chapter III.

The role of the [[dog in Chinese mythology]] includes a position as one of the twelve animals which cyclically represent years (the [[Dog (zodiac)|zodiacal dog]]).

===Literature===
In [[Homer]]'s [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] the ''[[Odyssey]]'', when the disguised [[Odysseus]] returns home after 20 years he is recognized only by his faithful dog, [[Argos (dog)|Argos]], who has been waiting for his return.

===Religion===
In Islam, dogs are viewed as unclean because they are viewed as [[scavenger]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherman2008&quot; /&gt;

[[Jewish law]] does not prohibit keeping dogs and other pets.&lt;ref name=&quot;jewishvirtuallibrary.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/animals.html|title=Judaism &amp; The Treatment of Animals |work=Jewish Virtual Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish law requires Jews to feed dogs (and other animals that they own) before themselves, and make arrangements for feeding them before obtaining them.&lt;ref name=&quot;jewishvirtuallibrary.org&quot;/&gt; In Christianity, dogs represent faithfulness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherman2008&quot;/&gt;

In China, Korea, and Japan, dogs are viewed as kind protectors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherman2008&quot;/&gt;

===Art===
{{Main article|Cultural depictions of dogs in Western art}}
{{commons category|Dogs in art}}
Cultural depictions of dogs in art extend back thousands of years to when dogs were portrayed on the walls of caves. Representations of dogs became more elaborate as individual breeds evolved and the relationships between human and canine developed. [[Hunting]] scenes were popular in the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]]. Dogs were depicted to symbolize guidance, protection, loyalty, fidelity, faithfulness, watchfulness, and love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.incredibleart.org/lessons/middle/animals2.htm|title=Animal Symbolism in Many Cultures}}&lt;/ref&gt;
