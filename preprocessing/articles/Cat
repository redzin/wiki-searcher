They are often called '''house cats''' when kept as indoor [[pet]]s or simply '''cats''' when there is no need to distinguish them from other [[Felidae|felids]] and [[Felinae|felines]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AHD&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url= http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/housecat |title= Housecat |work= American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |edition= Yahoo.com online |publisher= Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |year=2010 |accessdate=6 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110718134211/http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/housecat |archivedate= 18 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt [[vermin]]. There are more than 70 cat [[breed]]s, though different associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards.

Cats are similar in [[Cat anatomy|anatomy]] to the other felids, with a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey. [[Cat senses]] fit a [[crepuscular]] and predatory [[ecological niche]]. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in [[frequency]] for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals. They can see in near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have poorer [[color vision]] and a better [[Olfaction|sense of smell]] than humans. Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a [[social animal|social species]] and [[cat communication]] includes the use of a variety of [[Animal communication|vocalization]]s ([[Cat communication|mewing]], [[purr]]ing, [[Trill consonant|trilling]], hissing, [[growling]], and [[Guttural|grunting]]), as well as [[cat pheromone]]s and types of [[Cat body language|cat-specific body language]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Moelk&quot; /&gt;

Similar forms exist in Lithuanian ''puižė'' and [[Irish language|Irish]] ''puiscín''. The etymology of this word is unknown, but it may have simply arisen from a sound used to attract a cat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/155147#eid27609702|title=Puss|work=The Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gramercy Unabridged&quot;&gt;''Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language''.

A [[Pedigree (cat)|pedigreed cat]] is one whose ancestry is recorded by a [[Cat fancy|cat fancier]] organization. A [[purebred cat]] is one whose ancestry contains only individuals of the same breed. Many pedigreed and especially purebred cats are exhibited as [[show cat]]s. Cats of unrecorded, mixed ancestry are referred to as [[Domestic short-haired cat|domestic short-haired]] or [[domestic long-haired cat]]s, by [[Coat (animal)|coat]] type, or commonly as random-bred, moggies (chiefly [[British English|British]]), or (using terms borrowed from [[Dog breeds|dog breeding]]) mongrels or mutt-cats.

While the [[African wildcat]] is the ancestral subspecies from which domestic cats are descended, and wildcats and domestic cats can completely interbreed (being subspecies of the same species), several intermediate stages occur between domestic pet and pedigree cats on one hand and entirely wild animals on the other. The semiferal cat, a mostly outdoor cat, is not owned by any one individual, but is generally friendly to people and may be fed by several households. [[Feral cat]]s are associated with human habitation areas and may be fed by people or forage for food, but are typically wary of human interaction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bradshaw1999&quot; /&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cats are capable of walking very precisely because, like all [[Felinae|felines]], they directly register; that is, they place each hind paw (almost) directly in the print of the corresponding fore paw, minimizing noise and visible tracks. This also provides sure footing for their hind paws when they navigate rough terrain. Unlike most mammals, when cats walk, they use a &quot;pacing&quot; [[gait]]; that is, they move the two legs on one side of the body before the legs on the other side. This trait is shared with [[camel]]s and [[giraffe]]s. As a walk speeds up into a trot, a cat's gait changes to be a &quot;diagonal&quot; gait, similar to that of most other mammals (and many other land animals, such as [[lizard]]s): the diagonally opposite hind and fore legs move simultaneously.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christensen 2004&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cats and many other animals have a [[Jacobson's organ]] located in their mouths that allows them to taste-smell certain aromas in a way of which humans have no experience. Cats also have a distinct temperature preference for their food, preferring food with a temperature around {{convert|38|C|abbr=on}} which is similar to that of a fresh kill and routinely rejecting food presented cold or refrigerated (which would signal to the cat that the &quot;prey&quot; item is long dead and therefore possibly toxic or decomposing).&lt;ref name=sch/&gt;
[[File:Kittyply edit1.jpg|thumb|right|The whiskers of a cat are highly sensitive to touch.]]
To aid with navigation and sensation, cats have dozens of movable [[vibrissa|whiskers (vibrissae)]] over their body, especially their faces. These provide information on the width of gaps and on the location of objects in the dark, both by touching objects directly and by sensing air currents; they also trigger protective [[blink reflex]]es to protect the eyes from damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Case&quot; /&gt;{{rp|47}}

Most breeds of cat have a noted fondness for settling in high places, or perching. In the wild, a higher place may serve as a concealed site from which to hunt; domestic cats may strike prey by pouncing from a perch such as a tree branch, as does a [[leopard]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nash FS&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible explanation is that height gives the cat a better observation point, allowing it to survey its territory. During a fall from a high place, a cat can reflexively twist its body and right itself using its acute [[equilibrioception|sense of balance]] and flexibility.&lt;ref name=&quot;falling&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as the [[cat righting reflex]]. An individual cat always rights itself in the same way, provided it has the time to do so, during a fall. The height required for this to occur is around {{convert|90|cm|ft|abbr=on}}. Cats without a tail (e.g. [[Manx (cat)|Manx cats]]) also have this ability, since a cat mostly moves its hind legs and relies on conservation of [[angular momentum]] to set up for landing, and the tail is little used for this feat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nguyen 1998&quot;&gt;{{cite web

A wide range of health problems may affect cats, including infectious diseases, parasites, injuries, and chronic disease. [[Feline vaccination|Vaccinations]] are available for many of these diseases, and domestic cats are regularly given treatments to eliminate parasites such as worms and fleas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.petmd.com/blogs/thedailyvet/lhuston/2012/dec/veterinary-care-for-your-new-cat-29565 |title=Veterinary Care for Your New Cat |first=Lorie |last=Huston |publisher=petMD |date=17 December 2012 |accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to obvious dangers such as [[rodenticide]]s, [[insecticide]]s, and [[herbicide]]s, cats may be poisoned by many chemicals usually considered safe by their human guardians,&lt;ref name=&quot;vetinfo&quot; /&gt; because their livers are less effective at some forms of [[detoxification]] than those of many other animals, including humans and dogs.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacDonald&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams 1978&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

They may also vocalize loudly and bare their teeth in an effort to further intimidate their opponent.

Serious damage is rare, as the fights are usually short in duration, with the loser running away with little more than a few scratches to the face and ears. However, fights for mating rights are typically more severe and injuries may include deep puncture wounds and lacerations. Normally, serious injuries from fighting are limited to infections of scratches and bites, though these can occasionally kill cats if untreated. In addition, bites are probably the main route of transmission of [[feline immunodeficiency virus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pederson 1989&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

Perhaps the best known element of cats' hunting behavior, which is commonly misunderstood and often appalls cat owners because it looks like torture, is that cats often appear to &quot;play&quot; with prey by releasing it after capture. This behavior is due to an instinctive imperative to ensure that the prey is weak enough to be killed without endangering the cat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why do cats play with their food?|url=http://azdailysun.com/lifestyles/pets/article_46a97775-232d-5e56-b0ea-dd1c8782b062.html|publisher=Arizona Daily Sun|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This behavior is referred to in the [[idiom]] &quot;cat-and-mouse game&quot; or simply &quot;[[cat and mouse]]&quot;.

Another poorly understood element of cat hunting behavior is the presentation of prey to human guardians. [[Ethology|Ethologist]] Paul Leyhausen proposed that cats adopt humans into their social group and share excess kill with others in the group according to the [[dominance hierarchy]], in which humans are reacted to as if they are at, or near, the top.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leyhausen 1978&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

Female cats are seasonally [[polyestrous]], which means they may have many periods of [[Estrus|heat]] over the course of a year, the season beginning in spring and ending in late autumn. Heat periods occur about every two weeks and last about 4 to 7 days.&lt;ref name=&quot;compendium&quot; /&gt; Multiple males will be attracted to a female in heat. The males will fight over her, and the victor wins the right to mate. At first, the female rejects the male, but eventually the female allows the male to mate. The female utters a loud yowl as the male pulls out of her because a male cat's penis has a band of about 120–150 backwards-pointing [[penile spines]], which are about 1&amp;nbsp;mm long; upon withdrawal of the penis, the spines rake the walls of the female's [[vagina]], which is a trigger for [[ovulation]]. This act also occurs to clear the vagina of other sperm in the context of a second (or more) mating, thus giving the later males a larger chance of conception.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aronson 1967&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

After mating, the female washes her [[vulva]] thoroughly. If a male attempts to mate with her at this point, the female will attack him. After about 20 to 30 minutes, once the female is finished grooming, the cycle will repeat.&lt;ref name=&quot;compendium&quot; /&gt;

Feral cats are domestic cats that were born in or have reverted to a wild state. They are unfamiliar with and wary of humans and roam freely in urban and rural areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rochlitz&quot; /&gt; The numbers of feral cats is not known, but estimates of the US feral population range from 25 to 60&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rochlitz&quot; /&gt; Feral cats may live alone, but most are found in large [[feral cat colony|colonies]], which occupy a specific territory and are usually associated with a source of food.&lt;ref name=&quot;hsus-feral&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hsus.org/pets/issues_affecting_our_pets/feral_cats/feral_cats_frequently_asked_questions.html#1_What_is_a_feral_cat |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501093143/http://www.hsus.org/pets/issues_affecting_our_pets/feral_cats/feral_cats_frequently_asked_questions.html#1_What_is_a_feral_cat |archivedate=1 May 2008 | title=What is the difference between a stray cat and a feral cat? |publisher=Humane Society of the United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; Famous feral cat colonies are found in Rome around the [[Colosseum]] and [[Forum Romanum]], with cats at some of these sites being fed and given medical attention by volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.romancats.com/index_eng.php | title=Torre Argentina cat shelter. | accessdate=17 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; One common approach to reducing the feral cat population is termed 'trap-neuter-return', where the cats are trapped, [[neutering|neutered]], [[immunization|immunized]] against diseases such as rabies and the feline Panleukopenia and [[feline leukemia virus|Leukemia viruses]], and then released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de/23815/1/oa_23815.pdf|title=2013 AAFP Feline Vaccination Advisory Panel Report|accessdate=10 August 2017|publisher=Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery|date=2013|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before releasing them back into their feral colonies, the attending veterinarian often nips the tip off one ear to mark it as neutered and inoculated, since these cats may be trapped again. Volunteers continue to feed and give care to these cats throughout their lives. Given this support, their lifespans are increased, and behavior and nuisance problems caused by competition for food are reduced.&lt;ref name=&quot;hsus-feral&quot; /&gt;

===Cat bites and scratches===
{{Main|Cat bite}}
Cats may bite humans when provoked, during play or when aggressive. Complications from cat bites can develop.&lt;ref name = kidshealth&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/animal-bites-sheet.html?WT.ac=p-ra|title=First Aid: Animal Bites|publisher = The Nemours Foundation|language=en|access-date=2017-06-18 | date = 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cat bite differs from the bites of other pets. This is because the teeth of a cat are sharp and pointed causing deep [[wound|punctures]]. Skin usually closes rapidly over the bite and traps [[microorganisms]] that cause [[infection]].&lt;ref name = assh&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assh.org/handcare/hand-arm-injuries/animal-bites-treatment|title=Animal Bites|publisher = American Society for Surgery of the Hand | date = 2017 | website=Handcare.org|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = kidshealth/&gt;

===Infections transmitted from cats to humans===
{{Main article|Feline zoonosis}}

Cats can be [[infection|infected]] or infested with [[virus]]es, [[pathogenic bacteria|bacteria]], [[fungus]], [[protozoans]], [[arthropod]]s or worms that can transmit diseases to humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chomel2014&quot;/&gt; In some cases, the cat exhibits no [[symptoms]] of the disease,&lt;ref name=Ohio2016&gt;{{cite web | title = Cats |publisher=Ohio Department of Health|url = http://www.odh.ohio.gov/en/odhprograms/bid/zdp/animals/cats | accessdate = 26 November 2016 |date=21 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the same disease can then become evident in a human.  The likelihood that a person will become diseased depends on the age and [[immunity (medical)|immune]] status of the person. Humans who have cats living in their home or in close association are more likely to become infected, however, those who do not keep cats as pets might also acquire infections from cat [[feces]] and [[parasite]]s exiting the cat's body.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chomel2014&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chomel|first1=Bruno|title=Emerging and Re-Emerging Zoonoses of Dogs and Cats|journal=Animals|volume=4|issue=3|year=2014|pages=434–445|issn=2076-2615|doi=10.3390/ani4030434|PMID=26480316|pmc=4494318}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;StullBrophy2015&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stull|first1=J.

===History and mythology===
{{Main article|Cultural depictions of cats|Cats in ancient Egypt}}
[[File:PSM V37 D105 English tabby cat.jpg|thumb|right|A 19th century drawing of a tabby cat]]
Traditionally, historians tended to think [[ancient Egypt]] was the site of cat domestication, owing to the clear depictions of house cats in Egyptian paintings about 3,600 years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;Driscoll&quot; /&gt; However, in 2004, a Neolithic grave excavated in [[Shillourokambos]], [[Cyprus]], contained the skeletons, laid close to one another, of both a human and a cat. The grave is estimated to be 9,500 years old, pushing back the earliest known feline–human association significantly.&lt;ref name=&quot;9500 years&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Muir 2004&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

This discovery, combined with genetic studies, suggests cats were probably domesticated in the Middle East, in the [[Fertile Crescent]] around the time of the [[History of agriculture|development of agriculture]], and then were brought to Cyprus and Egypt.&lt;ref name=&quot;DriscollMenotti-Raymond2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OttoniVan Neer2017&quot;/&gt;

Direct evidence for the domestication of cats 5,300 years ago in Quanhucun, [[China]] has been published by archaeologists and paleontologists from the [[University of Washington]] and [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]]. The cats are believed to have been attracted to the village by rodents, which in turn were attracted by grain cultivated and stored by humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nacion.com/vivir/ciencia/Gatos-domesticados-China-hace-anos_0_1385061482.html|title=Gatos fueron domesticados en China hace 5.300 años|work=La Nación|accessdate=9 September 2014|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several ancient religions believed cats are exalted souls, companions or guides for humans, that are all-knowing but mute so they cannot influence decisions made by humans. In Japan, the ''[[maneki neko]]'' cat is a symbol of good fortune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darumamagazine.com/new/articles-excerpts/maneki-neko-feline-fact-fiction/ |title=Maneki Neko: Feline Fact &amp; Fiction |author=Alan Pate |work=Daruma Magazine |publisher=Takeguchi Momoko |location=Amagasaki, Japan |year=2008 |accessdate=30 December 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DIDy4b8G?url=http://www.darumamagazine.com/new/articles-excerpts/maneki-neko-feline-fact-fiction/ |archivedate=30 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Superstitions and cat burning ====
Many cultures have negative [[superstition]]s about cats. An example would be the belief that a [[black cat]] &quot;crossing one's path&quot; leads to bad luck, or that cats are witches' [[familiar spirit|familiar]]s used to augment a witch's powers and skills. The killing of cats in Medieval [[Ypres]], [[Belgium]], is commemorated in the innocuous present-day [[Kattenstoet]] (cat parade).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Are Black Cats Really Bad Luck? [Hoax]|url=http://socialnewsdaily.com/58901/are-black-cats-really-bad-luck-hoax/|website=SocialNewsDaily|accessdate=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In medieval France, cats would be burnt alive as a form of entertainment. According to [[Norman Davies]], the assembled people &quot;shrieked with laughter as the animals, howling with pain, were singed, roasted, and finally [[Carbonization|carbonized]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davies|first=Norman|title=Europe: a History|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=|isbn=0-198-20171-0|pages=543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;It was the custom to burn a basket, barrel, or sack full of live cats, which was hung from a tall mast in the midst of the bonfire; sometimes a [[fox]] was burned. The people collected the embers and ashes of the fire and took them home, believing that they brought good luck. The French kings often witnessed these spectacles and even lit the bonfire with their own hands. In 1648 [[Louis XIV]], crowned with a wreath of roses and carrying a bunch of roses in his hand, kindled the fire, danced at it and partook of the banquet afterwards in the town hall. But this was the last occasion when a monarch presided at the midsummer bonfire in Paris. At [[Metz]] midsummer fires were lighted with great pomp on the esplanade, and a dozen cats, enclosed in [[wicker]] cages, were burned alive in them, to the amusement of the people. Similarly at [[Gap, Hautes-Alpes|Gap]], in the [[Departments of France|department]] of the [[Hautes-Alpes]], cats used to be roasted over the midsummer bonfire.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[James Frazer|Frazer, Sir James George]]. ''The Golden Bough'', (1922). [http://www.bartleby.com/196/164.html Online version.]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a myth in many cultures, cats have multiple lives. In many countries, they are believed to have nine lives, but in Italy, Germany, Greece, Brazil and some Spanish-speaking regions, they are said to have seven lives,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://elcomercio.pe/impresa/notas/vidas-gato/20100307/423959 |date=7 March 2010 |accessdate=19 March 2010 |author=Nora Sugobono |language=Spanish |title=Las vidas del gato |publisher=El Comercio |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127052854/http://elcomercio.pe/impresa/notas/vidas-gato/20100307/423959 |archivedate=27 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Qual é a origem da lenda de que os gatos teriam sete vidas?|url=http://mundoestranho.abril.com.br/materia/qual-e-a-origem-da-lenda-de-que-os-gatos-teriam-sete-vidas|website=[[Mundo Estranho]]|publisher=[[Editora Abril]]|accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in Turkish and Arabic traditions, the number of lives is six.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=The Guardian |location=UK |url= https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gallery/2010/mar/18/guide-to-pets-pet-myths?picture=360591960|accessdate=18 March 2010|author=Tim Dowling|title=Tall tails: Pet myths busted|date=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The myth is attributed to the natural suppleness and swiftness cats exhibit to escape life-threatening situations. Also lending credence to this myth is the fact that falling cats often land on their feet, using an instinctive [[cat righting reflex|righting reflex]] to twist their bodies around. Nonetheless, cats can still be injured or killed by a high fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cats.about.com/od/catsafety/a/highrisefalls.htm|title=The ASPCA Warns About High-Rise Falls by Cats|author=ASPCA|date=30 June 2005|publisher=About.com|accessdate=26 April 2012|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;
