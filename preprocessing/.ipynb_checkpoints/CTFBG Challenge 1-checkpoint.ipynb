killing small prey. cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory ecological niche. cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals. they can see in near darkness. like most other mammals, cats have poorer color vision and a better olfaction sense of smell than humans. cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a social

cat, is its \"sire\",<ref></ref> and its female progenitor is its \"dam\".<ref></ref> in early modern english, the word 'kitten' was interchangeable with the now-obsolete word 'catling'.<ref></ref>a pedigree (cat) pedigreed cat is one whose ancestry is recorded by a cat fancy cat fancier organization. a purebred cat is one whose ancestry contains only individuals of the same breed. many pedigreed and especially purebred cats are exhibited as show cats. cats of unrecorded, mixed ancestry are referred to as domestic short-haired cat domestic short-haired or domestic long-haired cats, by coat

ancestral subspecies from which domestic cats are descended, and wildcats and domestic cats can completely interbreed (being subspecies of the same species), several intermediate stages occur between domestic pet and pedigree cats on one hand and entirely wild animals on the other. the semiferal cat, a mostly outdoor cat, is not owned by any one individual, but is generally friendly to people and

averaging  in length.<ref name=\"animal bytes\"></ref>cats have seven cervical vertebrae, as do almost all mammals; 13 thoracic vertebrae (humans have 12); seven lumbar vertebrae (humans have five); three sacrum sacral vertebrae like most mammals (humans have five); and a variable number of caudal vertebrae in the tail (humans retain three to five caudal vertebrae, fused into an internal coccyx).<ref name=\"walker\"></ref> the extra lumbar and thoracic vertebrae account for the cat's spinal mobility and flexibility. attached to the spine are 13 ribs, the shoulder, and the pelvis.<ref name=\"walker\" />  unlike human arms, cat forelimbs are attached to the shoulder by free-floating clavicle bones which allow them to pass their body through any space into which they can fit their head.<ref name=\"gillis 2002\"></ref>file:cat skull.jpg thumb left cat skullthe cat skull is unusual among mammals in having very large eye sockets and a powerful and specialized jaw.<ref name=\"case\">*</ref> within the jaw, cats have teeth adapted for killing prey and tearing meat. when it overpowers its prey, a cat delivers a lethal neck bite with its two long canine tooth canine teeth, inserting them between two of the prey's vertebrae and severing its spinal cord, causing irreversible paralysis and death.<ref name=\"smith1992\"></ref> compared to other felines, domestic cats have narrowly spaced canine teeth, which is an adaptation to their preferred prey of small rodents, which have small vertebrae.<ref name=\"smith1992\" /> the premolar and first molar (tooth) molar together compose the carnassial pair on each side of the mouth, which efficiently shears meat into small pieces, like a pair of scissors. these are vital in feeding, since cats' small molar (tooth) molars cannot chew food effectively, and cats are largely incapable of mastication.<ref name=\"case\" />  though cats tend to have better teeth than most humans, with decay generally less likely because of a thicker protective layer of enamel, a less damaging saliva, less retention of food particles between teeth, and a diet mostly devoid of sugar, they are nonetheless subject to occasional tooth loss and infection.<ref name=\"carr1978\"></ref>cats, like dogs, are digitigrades. they walk directly on their toes, with the bones of their feet making up the lower part of the visible leg.<ref name=\"lacquaniti 1999\"></ref> cats are capable of walking very precisely because, like all felinae felines, they directly register; that is, they place each hind paw (almost) directly in the print of the corresponding fore paw, minimizing noise and visible tracks. this also provides sure footing for their hind paws when they navigate rough terrain. unlike most mammals, when cats walk, they use a \"pacing\" gait; that is, they move the two legs on one side of the body before the legs on the other side. this trait is shared with camels and giraffes. as a walk speeds up into a trot, a cat's gait changes to be a \"diagonal\" gait, similar to that of most other mammals (and many other land animals, such as lizards): the diagonally opposite hind and fore legs move simultaneously.<ref name=\"christensen 2004\"></ref>like almost all members of the felidae, cats have protractable and retractable claws.<ref name=\"russell 2001\"></ref> in their normal, relaxed position, the claws are sheathed with the skin and fur around the paw's toe pads. this keeps the claws sharp by preventing wear from contact with the ground and allows the silent stalking of prey. the claws on the fore feet are typically sharper than those on the hind feet.<ref name=\"armes 1900\"></ref> cats can voluntarily extend their claws on one or more paws. they may extend their claws in hunting or self-defense, climbing, kneading (cats) kneading, or for extra traction on soft surfaces. most cats have five claws on their front paws, and four on their rear paws.<ref name=\"danforth1947\"></ref> the fifth front claw (the dewclaw) is proximal to the other claws. more proximally is a protrusion which appears to be a sixth \"finger\". this special feature of the front paws, on the inside of the wrists, is the carpal pad, also found on the paws of big cats and dogs. it has no function in normal walking, but is thought to be an antiskidding device used while jumping. some breeds of cats are prone to polydactyl cat polydactyly (extra toes and claws).<ref name=\"danforth1947\" /> these are particularly common along the northeast coast of north america.<ref name=\"lettice 2008\"></ref>===physiology===cats are familiar and easily kept animals, and their physiology has been particularly well studied; it generally resembles those of other carnivorous mammals, but displays several unusual features probably attributable to cats' descent from desert-dwelling species.<ref name=\"macdonald\" /> for instance, cats are able to tolerate quite high temperatures: humans generally start to feel uncomfortable when their skin temperature passes about , but cats show no discomfort until their skin reaches around ,<ref name=\"case\" /> and can tolerate temperatures of up to  if they have access to water.<ref name=\"sdcn\"></ref>{  class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:left; margin:10px\" + normal physiological values<ref name=\"kahn\"></ref> - body

pads,<ref></ref> and thermoregulation#endothermy pant for heat relief only at very high temperatures<ref name=\"adams 1970\"></ref> (but may also pant when stressed). a cat's body temperature does not vary throughout the day; this is part of cats' general lack of circadian rhythms and may reflect their tendency to be active both during the day and at night.<ref name=\"can\"></ref> cats' feces are comparatively dry and their urine is highly concentrated, both of which are adaptations to allow cats to retain as much water as possible.<ref name=\"macdonald\" /> their kidneys are so efficient, they can survive on a diet consisting only of meat, with no additional water,<ref name=\"prentiss 1959\"></ref> and can even rehydrate by drinking seawater.<ref name=\"can\" /><ref name=\"wolf 1959\"></ref> while domestic cats are able to swim, they are generally reluctant to enter water as it quickly leads to exhaustion.<ref name=\"fraser2012\"></ref>cats are obligate carnivores: their physiology has evolved to efficiently process meat, and they have difficulty digesting plant matter.<ref name=\"macdonald\"></ref> in contrast to omnivores such as rats, which only require about 4% protein in their diet, about 20% of a cat's diet must be protein.<ref name=\"macdonald\" /> cats are unusually dependent on a constant supply of the amino acid arginine, and a diet lacking arginine causes marked weight loss and can be rapidly fatal.<ref name=\"morris 1978\"></ref> another unusual feature is that the cat cannot produce taurine, with taurine deficiency causing macular degeneration, wherein the cat's retina slowly degenerates, causing irreversible blindness.<ref name=\"macdonald\" />a cat's gut (anatomy) gastrointestinal tract is adapted to meat eating, being much shorter than that of omnivores and having low levels of several of the digestive enzymes needed to digest carbohydrates.<ref name=\"zoran\"></ref> these traits severely limit the cat's ability to digest and use plant-derived nutrients, as well as certain fatty acids.<ref name=\"zoran\" /> despite the cat's meat-oriented physiology, several vegetarian or vegan cat foods have been marketed that are supplemented with chemical synthesis chemically synthesized taurine and other nutrients, in attempts to produce a complete diet. however, some of these products still fail to provide all the nutrients cats require,<ref name=\"gray 2004\"></ref> and diets containing no animal products pose the risk of causing severe nutritional deficiencies.<ref name=\"zaghini\"></ref> however, vets in the united states have expressed concern that many domestic cats are overfed.<ref name=\"how cats clawed their way into our hearts\"></ref>cats do eat grass occasionally. a proposed explanation is that cats use grass as a source of folic acid. another proposed explanation is that it is used to supply dietary fiber, helping the cat defecation defecate more easily and expel parasites and other harmful material through feces and vomit.<ref name=\"eatgrass\"></ref>===senses===image:tapetumlucidum.jpg thumb left reflection of camera flash from the tapetum lucidumcats have excellent night vision and can see at only one-sixth the light level required for human vision.<ref name=\"case\" /> this is partly the result of cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum, which reflects any light that passes through the retina back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's sensitivity to dim light.<ref name=\"olliver 2004\"></ref> another adaptation to dim light is the large pupils of cats' eyes. unlike some big cats, such as tigers, domestic cats have pupil#in other animals slit pupils.<ref name=\"malmstrom\" /> these slit pupils can focus bright light without chromatic aberration, and are needed since the domestic cat's pupils are much larger, relative to their eyes, than the pupils of the big cats.<ref name=\"malmstrom\"></ref> at low light levels a cat's pupils will expand to cover most of the exposed surface of its eyes.<ref name=\"hammond 1985\"></ref> however, domestic cats have rather poor color vision and (like most nonprimate mammals) have only two types of cone cell cones, optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green; they have limited ability to distinguish between red and green.<ref name=\"loop 1978\"></ref> a 1993 paper reported<!-- the paper didn't find anything, the researchers did --> a response to middle wavelengths from a system other than the rod cell rods which might be due to a third type of cone. however, this appears to be an adaptation to low light levels rather than representing true trichromacy trichromatic vision.<ref name=\"schneider 1993\"></ref>cats have excellent hearing and can detect an extremely broad range of frequencies. they can hear higher-pitched sounds than either dogs or humans, detecting frequencies from 55&nbsp;hz to 79,000&nbsp;hz, a range of 10.5&nbsp;octaves, while humans and dogs both have ranges of about 9&nbsp;octaves.<ref name=\"pmid15472899\"></ref><ref name=\"h. heffner 1998\"></ref> cats can hear ultrasound, which is important in hunting<ref name=\"sunquist\"></ref> because many species of rodents make ultrasonic calls.<ref name=\"blumberg 1992\"></ref> however, they do not communicate using ultrasound like rodents do. cats' hearing is also sensitive and among the best of any mammal,<ref name=\"pmid15472899\" /> being most acute in the range of 500&nbsp;hz to 32&nbsp;khz.<ref></ref> this sensitivity is further enhanced by the cat's large movable outer ears (their pinna (anatomy) pinnae), which both amplify sounds and help detect the direction of a noise.<ref name=\"sunquist\" />cats have an acute sense of smell, due in part to their well-developed olfactory bulb and a large surface of olfactory mucosa, about  in area, which is about twice that of humans<!-- impossible logic and only 1.7-fold less than the average dog. -->.<ref name=\"moulton 1967\"></ref> cats are sensitive to cat pheromone pheromones such as 3-mercapto-3-methylbutan-1-ol,<ref name=\"felinine\"></ref> which they use to communicate through urine spraying and marking with scent glands.<ref name=\"sommerville\" /> many cats also respond strongly to plants that contain nepetalactone, especially catnip, as they can detect that substance at less than one part per billion.<ref></ref>  about 70–80% of cats are affected by nepetalactone.<ref></ref> this response is also produced by other plants, such as silver vine (''actinidia polygama'') and the herb valerian (herb) valerian; it may be caused by the smell of these plants mimicking a pheromone and stimulating cats' social or sexual behaviors.<ref name=\"tucker\"></ref>cats have relatively few taste buds compared to humans (470 or so versus more than 9,000 on the human tongue).<ref name=sch></ref> domestic and wild cats share a gene mutation that keeps their sweet taste buds from binding to sugary molecules, leaving them with no ability to taste sweetness.<ref></ref> their taste buds instead respond to amino acids, bitter tastes, and acids.<ref name=\"bradshaw2006\"></ref>  cats and many other animals have a jacobson's organ located in their mouths that allows them to taste-smell certain aromas in a way of which humans have no experience. cats also have a distinct temperature preference for their food, preferring food with a temperature around  which is similar to that of a fresh kill and routinely rejecting food presented cold or refrigerated (which would signal to the cat that the \"prey\" item is long dead and therefore possibly toxic or decomposing).<ref name=sch/>file:kittyply edit1.jpg thumb right the whiskers of a cat are highly sensitive to touch.to aid with navigation and sensation, cats have dozens of movable vibrissa whiskers (vibrissae) over their body, especially their faces. these provide information on the width of gaps and on the location of objects in the dark, both by touching objects directly and by sensing air currents; they also trigger protective blink reflexes to protect the eyes from damage.<ref name=\"case\" />most breeds of cat have a noted fondness for settling in high places, or perching. in the wild, a higher place may serve as a concealed site from which to hunt; domestic cats may strike prey by pouncing from a perch such as a tree branch, as does a leopard.<ref name=\"nash fs\"></ref> another possible explanation is that height gives the cat a better observation point, allowing it to survey its territory. during a fall from a high place, a cat can reflexively twist its body and right itself using its acute equilibrioception sense of balance and flexibility.<ref name=\"falling\"></ref> this is known as the cat righting reflex. an individual cat always rights itself in the same way, provided it has the time to do so, during a fall. the height required for this to occur is around . cats without a tail (e.g. manx (cat) manx cats) also have this ability, since a cat mostly moves its hind legs and relies on conservation of angular momentum to set up for landing, and the tail is little used for this feat.<ref name=\"nguyen 1998\"></ref>===health===the average lifespan of pet cats has risen in recent years. in the early 1980s, it was about seven years,<ref name=\"kraft 1998\"/><ref name=\"nassar 1984\"/> rising to 9.4 years in 1995<ref name=\"kraft 1998\"/> and 12–15 years in 2014.<ref></ref>however, cats have been reported as surviving into their 30s,<ref name=\"30yo\">example: </ref> with the oldest known cat,

social signal mechanisms in cats;<ref name=\"behaviourguide\" /><ref name=\"cafazzo\"></ref> for example, a raised tail acts as a friendly greeting, and flattened ears indicates hostility. tail-raising also indicates the cat's position in the group's social hierarchy, with dominant individuals raising their tails less often than subordinate animals.<ref name=\"cafazzo\" /> nose-to-nose touching is also a common greeting and may be followed by social grooming, which is solicited by one of the cats raising and tilting its head.<ref name=\"crowell-davis2004\" />purring may have

within a small home.<ref name=\"lindell\" /> female cats also fight over territory or to defend their kittens. neutering will decrease or eliminate this behavior in many cases, suggesting that the behavior is linked to sex hormones.<ref></ref>file:gato.jpg thumb an arched back, raised fur, and an open-mouthed hiss can all be signs of aggression in a domestic cat.when cats become aggressive, they try to make themselves appear larger and more threatening by raising their fur, arching their backs, turning sideways and hissing or spitting.<ref name=\"behaviourguide\"></ref> often, the ears are pointed down and back to avoid damage to the inner ear and potentially listen for any changes behind them while focused forward. they may also vocalize loudly and bare their teeth in an effort to further intimidate their opponent. fights usually consist of grappling and delivering powerful slaps to the face and body with the forepaws as well as bites. cats also throw themselves to the ground in a defensive posture to rake their opponent's belly with their powerful hind legs.<ref name=\"hsus\"></ref>serious damage is rare, as the fights are usually short in duration, with the loser running away with little more than a few scratches to the face and ears. however, fights for mating rights are typically more severe and injuries may include deep puncture wounds and lacerations. normally, serious injuries from fighting are limited to infections of scratches and bites, though these can occasionally kill cats if untreated. in addition, bites are probably the main route of transmission of feline immunodeficiency virus.<ref name=\"pederson 1989\"></ref> sexually active males are usually involved in many fights during their lives, and often have decidedly battered faces with obvious

name=\"turner 2000\"></ref>perhaps the best known element of cats' hunting behavior, which is commonly misunderstood and often appalls cat owners because it looks like torture, is that cats often appear to \"play\" with prey by releasing it after capture. this behavior is due to an instinctive imperative to ensure that the prey is weak enough to be killed without endangering the cat.<ref></ref> this behavior is referred to in the idiom \"cat-and-mouse game\" or simply \"cat and mouse\".another poorly understood element of cat hunting behavior is the presentation of prey to human guardians. ethology ethologist paul leyhausen proposed that cats adopt humans into their social group and share excess kill with others in the group according to the dominance hierarchy, in which humans are reacted to as if they are at, or near, the top.<ref name=\"leyhausen 1978\"></ref> anthropologist and zoologist desmond morris, in his 1986 book ''catwatching'', suggests, when cats bring home mice or birds, they are attempting to teach their human to hunt, or trying to help their human as if feeding \"an elderly cat, or an inept kitten\".<ref name=\"morris catwatching

superstitions and cat burning ====many cultures have negative superstitions about cats. an example would be the belief that a black cat \"crossing one's path\" leads to bad luck, or that cats are witches' familiar spirit familiars used to augment a witch's powers and skills. the killing of cats in medieval ypres, belgium, is commemorated in the innocuous present-day kattenstoet (cat parade).<ref></ref>in medieval france, cats would be burnt alive as a form of entertainment. according to norman davies, the assembled people \"shrieked with laughter as the animals, howling with pain, were singed, roasted, and finally carbonization carbonized\".<ref></ref>\"it was the custom to burn a basket, barrel, or sack full of live cats, which was hung from a tall mast in the midst of the bonfire; sometimes a fox was burned. the people collected the embers and ashes of the fire and took them home, believing that they brought good luck. the french kings often witnessed these spectacles and even lit the bonfire with their own hands. in 1648 louis xiv, crowned with a wreath of roses and carrying a bunch of roses in his hand, kindled the fire, danced at it and partook of the banquet afterwards in the town hall. but this was the last occasion when a monarch presided at the midsummer bonfire in paris. at metz midsummer fires were lighted with great pomp on the esplanade, and a dozen cats, enclosed in wicker cages, were burned alive in them, to the amusement of the people. similarly at gap, hautes-alpes gap, in the departments of france department of the hautes-alpes,
